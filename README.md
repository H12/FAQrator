## Description
FAQrator is a tool for creating dynamic ad-hoc FAQS for events like lectures, classes, projects, etc. Users can create topics, which will allow users to submit questions to be answered. The topic creator will be able to view the list of open questions and submit answers based on a secret edit page, which can be accessed by a generated key, so that they may be able to share list control with others. It will be possible to comment on both questions and answers, to stimulate dialogue between all participants.
